# IDOT-SmartWorkzone
This repository is a place holder for the source code developed during the project *"Improving the effectiveness of smart work zones"* (IDOT R27-155). 

This repository will include the following components upon the completion of the project by Oct 15, 2015.

1. Autocalibration of the microscopic parameters in AIMSUN, which uses Python scripting to automate the calibration of AIMSUN based on NOMAD optimization software. **Please refer to  for the [calibrated parameter values]().**
2. Virtual sensor data generator, which generates realistic sensors measurements using trajectory data from AIMSUN based on dedicated virtual sensor models develope in this project.
3. Implementation of interpolation, kernel filtering, and ensemble Kalman filter algorithms for estimation of the traffic speed, the queue length, and the travel time.
4. Analysis and visualization of estimation resutls.
